Please read the INSTALL file before running these commands.

Some examples:

{{{
dejumble /path/to/mount -o nonempty
dejumble /path/to/mount -o filter="Null",nonempty
dejumble /path/to/mount -o filter="OriginalDirectory",organizer="Documents",nonempty
dejumble /path/to/mount -o root="~/Music",query="find ~/Music/ -name *.mp3",filter="Shell",organizer="Flat",nonempty
}}}

to unmount:

{{{
fusermount -u /path/to/mount
}}}

The `nonempty` flag lets you mount over an existing directory. File contents are preserved in a special directory `.dejumblefs` that contains directories with all the previous directory structure and other information. This directory is not shown, not even with a `ls -a` but you can cd into it.

If you are using Mac OS X take a look at http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/wiki/OPTIONS to see more mount time options. Some of this also apply to other operating systems. The nonempty mount option does not work on OS X. See Known Issues at the bottom of this document.

==Filters==

  * `CompleteDirectory` - Provides a list of files that contains all the files present in a directory.
  * `OriginalDirectory` - Provides a list of files that contains all the files present before on the mounting directory.
  * `Null` - Provides a file 'null' that is a proxy for /dev/null, for testing purposes only.
  * `Shell` - Provides a list of files that are proxies for those returned by the shell script defined by 'query'.

Not implemented yet:  
  
  * `Xesam` - Executes a xesam query against the current search provider.

==Caches==

  * `PassThrough` - Writes and reads everything from the original filesystem all the time.
  * `Sandbox` - Treats the original filesystem as read-only and any changes are just saved to memory.

==Organizers==

  * `Original` - Shows the same directory structure as the original files.
  * `Flat` - Just shows the list of files provided all in one directory.
  * `ISO9660` - Converts all filenames to short file names like 8.3 DOS names (SomeFile.ext -> SOMEFI~1.EXT).
  * `Documents` - Organizes the files on folders by filetype.
  * `Date` - Organizes de files on folders by date.

Not implemented yet:  

  * `CaseInsensitive` - Treats all files names as case insensitive.
  * `Localization` - Uses a translation table to translate file names or directory names.

==Requirements==

  * python==1.5
  * python-setuptools>=0.6
  * psyco>=1.6
  * fuse-python>=0.2
  * PyDBLite==2.0_pep8 (Use the one on the support/PyDbLite folder which complies better 
    with pylint and pep8)
  * python-xesam (not yet, does this even exist?)

== Known issues ==

  * umount on Mac OS X is problematic. See http://code.google.com/p/dejumble/issues/detail?id=1
