Please read the INSTALL file before running these commands.

Some examples:

{{{
dejumble /path/to/mount -o nonempty
dejumble /path/to/mount -o filter="Null",nonempty
dejumble /path/to/mount -o filter="OriginalDirectory",organizer="Documents",nonempty
dejumble /path/to/mount -o query="find ~/Music/ -name *.mp3",filter="Shell",organizer="Flat",nonempty
}}}

to unmount:

{{{
fusermount -u /path/to/mount
}}}

The `nonempty` flag lets you mount over an existing directory. File contents are preserved in a special directory `.dejumblefs` that contains all the previous directory structure. This directory is not shown, not even with a `ls -a` but you can cd into it.

==Filters==

  * `CompleteDirectory` - Provides a list of files that contains all the files present in a directory.
  * `OriginalDirectory` - Provides a list of files that contains all the files present before on the mounting directory.
  * `Null` - Provides a file 'null' that is a proxy for /dev/null, for testing purposes only.
  * `Shell` - Provides a list of files that are proxies for those returned by the shell script defined by 'query'.

Not implemented yet:  
  
  * `Xesam` - Executes a xesam query against the current search provider.

==Caches==

  * `PassThrough` - Writes and reads everything from the original filesystem all the time.
  * `Sandbox` - Treats the original filesystem as read-only and any changes are just saved to memory.

==Organizers==

  * `Original` - Shows the same directory structure as the original files.
  * `Flat` - Just shows the list of files provided all in one directory.
  * `ISO9660` - Converts all filenames to short file names like 8.3 DOS names (SomeFile.ext -> SOMEFI~1.EXT).

  * `Documents` - Organizes the files on folders by filetype.
  * `Date` - Organizes de files on folders by date.

Not implemented yet:  

  * `CaseInsensitive` - Treats all files names as case insensitive.
  * `Localization` - Uses a translation table to translate file names or directory names.

==Requirements==

  * python
  * psyco
  * python-fuse
  * PyDBLite
  * python-xesam (not yet, does this even exist?)
