This thesis presents the theoretical bases for the implementation of a proxy file system. A proxy file system is a file system that does not contain files itself but instead uses another file system for that purpose. In this project this kind of file system will be used to experiment with alternative hierarchies for organizing files without the need to re-implement disk-access or disk-usage algorithms. The implementation of this file system will be done using existing technologies in order to enable it to be ported easily to different architectures and operating systems. It will be also built in a modular way to make it possible to use different module configurations in order to be expandable in the future by new modules. In addition to this, several tests will be performed to determine the real performance of different configurations of the proxy file system when listing and accessing multiple files.
