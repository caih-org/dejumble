Please read the INSTALL file before running these commands.

Some examples:

dejumble /path/to/mount -o query="",provider="Null",nonempty
dejumble /path/to/mount -o query="",provider="OriginalDirectory",nonempty
dejumble /path/to/mount -o query="find ~/Music/ -name *.mp3",provider="Shell",nonempty

to unmount:

fusermount -u /path/to/mount

=========
Providers
=========

Null - provides a file 'null' that is a proxy for /dev/null, for testing purposes only.
Shell - provides a list of files that are proxies for those returned by the shell script defined by 'query'
OriginalDirectory - provides a list of files that contains all the files present before on the mounting directory

Currently you need to provide a query even for those providers that don't require one.

The 'nonempty' flag lets you mount over an existing directory. File contents are preserved in a special directory '.dejumblefs_original_dir' that contains all the previous directory structure. This directory is not shown, not even with a 'ls -a' but you can cd into it.
