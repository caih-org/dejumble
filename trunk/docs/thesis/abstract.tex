\begin{abstracts} 
This dissertation proposes a generic infrastructure for the developing of
parallel and distributed applications on the Web.  This infrastructure
is oriented to allow that every single host in the Internet can
participate on the execution of distributed applications using a very
simple configuration with rigid guarantees of security.  Our proposal
is based on the use of the World Wide Web protocols and Java applets,
exclusively.  Thus, users willing to participate only require a
conventional Web browser with the Java Runtime Environment enabled.
This work differs from previous proposals in its simplicity and
improved performance.  In addition, our proposal includes a detailed
performance evaluation of real parallel applications.
